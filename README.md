# Dronestrike Data Visualization

Based on the this data visualization of Brexit created by the National, as a part of my internship for the news agency, I was tasked with developing a visualization for dronestrikes in Northwestern Pakistan. This visualization is intended to show the devastation that these strikes have caused for the people of the region, displaying the strikes' catastrophic civilian casualties. This project uses data from The Bureau of Investigative Journalism on the casualties of each strike in the region.

For this project I worked closely with the web development team and design team, trying to create as effective as a visualization as possible. Color choices were extremely important, as well as establishing where in Pakistan this map was. In order to do this, red was used for each hexagon to show that there were strikes in that location for that year and a dark green was used to show all the regions that were struck within the period from 2004 to 2017. Light green was used to denote areas of Pakistan that were not targeted by drone strikes and a light blue was used to show Afghanistan. The visualization uses a play button that makes the visualization play from that year until the final year (2017), as well as a scrollable timeline that allows users to see strike data on the map for that year.
